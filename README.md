# stretchableCircuit
A module to simulate the strain-dependent behavior of stretchable organic transistors and simple circuits. The model combines the theory of rubber elasticity with the gradual channel model for the current&#8211;voltage (<i>I&#8211;V</i>) characteristics of field-effect transistors. This module contains models for the behavior of organic thin film transistors (TFTs), organic electrochemical double layer transistors (EDLTs), and organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs). Please see the publication referenced below for more information, including the key assumptions made. The Jupyter notebook elasticTransistorNotebook.ipynb demonstrates how to create stretchable transistor and inverter objects, perform calculations of the strain-dependent behavior, and visualize the results.
